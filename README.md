# OpenWRT-Tools

Some simple CLI tools for use on my OpenWRT router.

All experimental and just whipped up as needed for quick easy insights into what is going on without relying on the web interface of the router to be up and running. 

I install them in /root/bin, ensure the scripts are executeable and add $HOME/bin to my path in .profile, so when I ssh to the router I can quickly access any of these for some tuned insights into what I want to know.
